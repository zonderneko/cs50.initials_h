README.md

Write, in a file called initials.c, a program that prompts a user for 
their name (using GetString to obtain their name as a string) and then 
outputs their initials in uppercase with no spaces or periods, followed 
by a newline (\n) and nothing more. You may assume that the user’s input 
will contain only letters (uppercase and/or lowercase) plus spaces. 
Folks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Conan O’Brien, and David J. Malan won’t 
be using your program. But the user’s input might be sloppy, in which 
case there might be one or more spaces at the start and/or end of the 
user’s input or even multiple spaces in a row.
